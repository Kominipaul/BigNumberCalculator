# Arithmetic Operations Program

This repository contains a simple C program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) on large two numbers. Implementing operations on very large numbers using a linked list can be an efficient way to handle arithmetic that exceeds the standard data type limits. The program provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kominipaul/BigNumberCalculator
cd BigNumberCalculator
```

### Compile the Code:

```bash
gcc Omada34.c -o BigNumberCalculator
```

### Run the Program:

```bash
./BigNumberCalculator
```

## Usage

### Menu Options:

The program displays the following menu options:

```
[0] Exit
[1] Addition
[2] Subtraction
[3] Multiplication
```

Enter the corresponding number to choose an operation.

### Input Numbers:

After selecting an operation, enter two numbers (as strings).

The program will process the input and convert it into numeric values.

### Processing and Results:

The program will handle negative numbers (if applicable) based on user input.

It will perform the chosen arithmetic operation and display the result.

## Example

Suppose you want to add two numbers:

1. Choose option 1 (Addition).
2. Enter the first number: 123.
3. Enter the second number: 456.

The program will display: `123 + 456 = 579`.
